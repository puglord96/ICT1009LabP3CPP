Since it's 96% chance to remain on the hook it would look like this:\n\n0.96*0.96*0.96 = roughly 0.885 or 88.5% chance of you remaining on the hook.\n\nThat means that 1 - 0.885 = 0.115 or about 11.5% of escaping assuming you try three times. \n\nThis isn't perfect math though because I am assuming you can always try to escape three times even if let's say your first attempt is successful, so the true number is probably slightly different but this is close enough.",

He mostly jogs around getting into position and only sprints when on or receiving the ball. His technique and creativity are still immaculate though. David Villa scored 13 goals in 28 matches during his stint at Vissel Kobe, despite his legs being gone, mostly thanks to Iniesta.\n\nJapanese football has improved on the whole. How much that is as a result from big international stars joining is impossible to assess though, but it helped getting them noticed at the very least.",

            "body": "There is a movie called murder by numbers. And the E in movie is switched to a 3 and the b in numbers is switched to an 8. So 38 is the number in the movie title. In GEMATRIA, (turning numbers into letter and letters into words, A practice thousands of years old started by the jews) death, RIP, killing, murder, all have the value of 38 with just using 4 cyphers. The cyphers are used to find the numeric value of the word. For instance death is 38 because the d is the 4th letter in the English alphabet, the e is the 5th, A is the 1st and so on and you add them up. The 3 other cyphers is the same idea just different rules. Also the band slip knot has a song named \u201cGematria\u201d and one of the band mates passed at 38. Also on March 3 I predicted on March 8 ( 3/8 ) there was gonna be a death in the celeb world, and the news is gonna post about death more than usual. And I was right. Max Von Sydow passed away at 90 years old. And guess what? Max=38 in 1 of 4 cyphers and von sydow = 38 in one of the 4 cyphers. CNN even posted ablut what they called the \u201cdeadliest\u201d day in world war 2 when the US \u201cfirebombed Tokyo Japan) fire =38 and \nTokyo Japan =38. Also something interesting is that from Kobe bryants wifes birthday, Sunday may 5, 2019 to the day Kobe passed Sunday January 26, 2020 was 266 days, or 38 weeks. And his death was from  3 months and 8 days from his fathers (joeBryant)birthday. Who played for the golden state worriers, \ngolden state worriers =41 in 1 outta 4 cyphers. And he was the 14th pick. Fourteen= 41 \nAnd his old teammate Shaquille o Neils birthday is March 6th which is 41 days from kobe passing. \nLA= 41 he played for the LA lakers. Also he was 41 when he died and his daughter was 13, and 41 is the 13th prime. And another thing real quick, if you add tha he\u2019s of Kobe and his daughter 41+13 you get 54.  And Joann Buss the wife of former lakers owner jerry buss has Gematria of 54. (Joann  = 54) and check this out. She died December 16 2019 which was 41 days before Kobe passed. And joe Bryant, Kobe Bryant\u2019s father was born October 19, 1954. And January 26 (date of Kobe dead) to October 19 his dads bday is not only 3 months and 8 days it\u2019s also a total of 100 days. \nOne hundred= 54. \n\nAlso juice wrld dropped his \u201cdeath race for love\u201d album on 3/8 and the name itself \u201cdeath race for love\u201d =38. He died later that year.",

A few more very credible videos from doctors and nurses there was the hammer for me to take action.  Funny enough, i got a lot of this early info off of 4chan.\n\nI decreased all my positions by half.  This was when their official case count was &lt;50.  I remember it well, because I sold a lot just a day after Kobe died.\n\nThe day in late February when the DJIA had its first -1000 point swing, I was kicking myself for still having a lot in the market.  I sold most off it a couple days later, when Biden upset Sanders on Super Tuesday, which was pretty much the final day of good prices and the Dow near 27000.\n\nIt's not a perfect timing though, as I did not have such convictions that I went heavy on puts.  I was just happy to be in cash to \"see what happens\".  I thought it would mostly affect China, slow manufacturing, and cause a small, but worldwide hit.  Didn't think it would shutdown the USA and EU to this extent so quickly.\n\nSo I saved a lot of my money, but did not profit off the downturn as I could have.  Hoping to make that up by picking up a ton of bargains now.\n\nI'm a gambler at heart, so I do try to time the market far more than just the DCA crowd on here.  Folding this hand early in, sensing a loser, is one of my better plays.  But folding my final hand on Super Tuesday, instead of the human desire to get back to the peak, is one of my proudest *moments* as a gambler / investor.",

Obviously, providing Ron \u201cmetta world peace\u201d artest a legendary moment in his long and controversial career. Also, it shows Kobe passing out of a potential double team(where he tries to fight through a lot of the time), with plenty of time on the shot clock, showing trust in his teammates that in previous years would not be the case. The 2010 championship was the ultimate team win for the lakers. \n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/uqf13CnVVSo) is the full highlights. Truly a fantastic game to watch.",
